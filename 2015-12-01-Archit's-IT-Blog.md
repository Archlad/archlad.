I.T Lesson

Last friday's I.T lesson was fantastic. Mr Keen taught us something we have never learnt before ; even though it was really difficult (well for me at least ) I really enjoyed it. It was way better than any other lesson that we do, even P.E! It was probably the best lesson so far.

The aim of the lesson was to get to the point where we could publish our own blogs. This would be carried out in numerous and arduous stages. Nevertheless, I was determined to accomplish my goal : To do everything that needs to be done in this lesson. 

However, that did not go as planned. I was able to complete the first fews steps fine without any hassle, but unfortunately I got stuck on a easy on! I tried and tried again but it just didn't work. I asked someone who had done it to help me but it was useless. Whilst Mr Keen explained how to do the next steps I was there still trying to figure out what happened or what I did wrong.

Apart from that everything else was fantastic!
